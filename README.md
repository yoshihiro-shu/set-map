# `setMap` Package README

## Overview

The `setMap` package provides a simple and efficient way to work with sets in Go. It's based on the concept of using Go maps to represent sets, where the map keys represent the set members and the map values are simply placeholders (of type `void`).

## Data Structures

### `void`
A placeholder type used to represent a member in the set.

### `any`
An interface type that can represent any value.

### `setMap`
The main type representing the set. It's a map where keys are of type `any` and values are of type `void`.

## Functions

### `New() setMap`
Creates a new empty set.

### Methods on `setMap`

#### `(s setMap) SADD(members ...interface{})`
Adds one or more members to the set.

#### `(s setMap) SREM(members ...interface{})`
Removes one or more members from the set.

#### `(s setMap) SISMEMBER(member interface{}) bool`
Checks if a member exists in the set. Returns `true` if the member exists, `false` otherwise.

#### `(s setMap) SCARD() int`
Returns the number of members in the set.

## Usage

1. Create a new set:

```go
s := setMap.New()
```

2. Add members to the set:

```go
s.SADD("apple", "banana", "cherry")
```

3. Remove members from the set:

```go
s.SREM("banana")
```

4. Check if a member exists in the set:

```go
exists := s.SISMEMBER("apple")  // true
```

5. Get the number of members in the set:

```go
count := s.SCARD()  // 2
```

## Conclusion

The setMap package offers a simple and efficient way to manage sets in Go without the need for third-party libraries. It leverages Go's built-in map data structure to provide fast operations on sets.
